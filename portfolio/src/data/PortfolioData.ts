            My journey into programming began in my first year of university, 
            with an intro course in Java that introduced me to fundamental programming concepts. 
            Since then, I've had to the opportunity to complete my degree in Computer Science, and 
            develop a strong interest in full-stack web development and data visualization. Discovering 
            and mastering new programming concepts is what fuels my enthusiasm to continously grow as a developer!

            Nothing is more important to me than my family. 
            I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be where I am today without their support. \
            The compassion and wisdom they imparted to me growing up has shaped me in ways that continue \
            to resonate through my daily actions. This influence is what drives me to be an excellent teammate \
            in a professional setting, and treat my peers with the same level of respect and \
            kindness that I receive from my own family.

            I'm a lifelong learner by nature, which makes me a fanatic for 
            travelling! It truly is a blessing to be able to learn about and embrace other cultures 
            around the world. Whether it's participating in local festivities, visiting historical 
            landmarks, or simply strolling through the city to admire the architecture. I enjoy discovering 
            what the world has to offer and how we've progressed into modern society.

            I don't play basketball much myself, but I've always been an enthusiastic 
            NBA fan. Besides the game, one aspect that's always stood out to me is the unique player 
            and team statistics displayed throughout, along with the creative visualizations that accompany 
            them. Also, for those curious, I'm a big time Houston Rockets fan. Hoping that Sengun is an 
            All-Star this year and we make the play-in tournament!

            Video games have been a significant part of my life for as long as I can remember. 
            My favorite genre is definitely single player, open-world RPGs that feature intricate world design, 
            deep lore and complex puzzles. Some of my top picks include The Witcher 3, the Uncharted series 
            and Horizon series. While I mostly play for enjoyment, I feel that video games also serve 
            as a great outlet for honing my problem solving skills and fostering my natural curiosity.
